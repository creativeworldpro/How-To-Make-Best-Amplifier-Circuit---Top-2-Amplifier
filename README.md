In this project, we are going to show you, making best quality amplifier circuit at home easily.
It is a very cheap and powerful amplifier circuit that, you can make at home easily.

You can use this amplifier circuit at home, office, cultural program, bike, truck and other places also.
To make this amplifier circuit, we might need some electronics component. Those component list have to been given below.

Component List – 
1. Separator
2. Heat sink
3. Transistor – 2SC 3858
                           TTA 1943
4. Copper Wire
5. Resistor -100 KΩ 
6. Capacitor - 100µf/35v
7. Audio Input Cable
8. Sound Speaker
9. Power Source – DC 12v

Transistor Pinout- 

2SC 3858 – 2SC 3858 is an NPN transistor.  As usual the transistor 2SC 3858 also contain 3 leg & this 3 leg’s also have 3 different names. If we count it’s leg from left side, then 1no “Base”. 2no “Collector” & 3no “Emitter”
TTA 1943 - TTA 1943 is an PNP transistor.  As usual the transistor TTA 1943 also contain 3 leg & this 3 leg’s also have 3 different names. If we count it’s leg from left side, then 1no “Base”. 2no “Collector” & 3no “Emitter”

Circuit Connection – 
1st we connect both transistor with heat sink. Then we connect 2SC3858 transistor “Collector” with TTA1943 transistor “Base” leg. Then we connect 2SC3858 transistor “Emitter” leg with “Collector” leg of TTA1943 transistor.
Now we connect 100 KΩ resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with “Base” leg of 2SC3858 transistor and “Emitter” leg of TTA1943 transistor.
It is the time to connect capacitor with the circuit. We connect this capacitor positive leg with “Base” leg of 2SC3858 transistor.
Now we connect audio input cable with the circuit. We connect audio input “L/R” cable with capacitor negative leg and connect audio input “G” cable with “Emitter” leg of 2SCC3858 transistor.
Then we need to connect speaker and power source with the circuit. For power source, we will use DC 12v. We connect DC 12v positive cable with sound speaker. Then we connect a blank cable with another terminal of speaker.
The blank cable was connected with sound speaker, we connect that cable with “Emitter” leg of TTA 1943 transistor and DC 12v negative cable with “Collector” of TTA1943 transistor.
Our circuit is now completely ready for use. We just connect audio input jack with audio source as a like mobile of mp3 player.
Just play music & enjoy the sound.
